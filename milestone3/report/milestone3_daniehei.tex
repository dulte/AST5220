\todo[inline]{Notes: As Psi crosses $a_eq$ the transfer function decreases the Psi that have not crossed the horizon to 9/10. If Psi crosses the horizon in the matter dominated regime, it stays constant. This is no longer the case when dark energy takes over, thus the dip in the end (described by the growth function). Growth function is independent of $k$, and is very small in dark energy dom., and we therefore see that perturbations flattens out near $x=0$.

In matter era. delta goes as a. In rad. dom. they grows as well but not as prominent. The pressure from the radiation slows the perturbations down, but as matter begins to dominate, the pressure weakens and the perturbations grow faster.

In rad. dom. the potential is determined by photons, and not dark matter. DM is instead determined by the potential. Potential decays in rad dom.

Seems that modes grows independent of $k$ after crossing the horizon.

The oscillations found in $\Theta_0$ is that makes $\delta_b$ oscillate, due to tight coupling.}
